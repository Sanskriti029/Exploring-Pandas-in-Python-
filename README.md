# Exploring-Pandas-in-Python-
Pandas simplify complex data operations, allowing you to handle large datasets with ease, transform raw data into meaningful insights, and perform a wide range of data analysis tasks with minimal code.
This repository demonstrates the power of Pandas in Python for data manipulation and analysis using the Search engines dataset. Alongside this, popular machine learning models such as Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression are applied to gain insights and predictions.

# Overview

This repository demonstrates how to implement and apply three core machine learning algorithms commonly used in data analysis:

Linear Regression: A linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple, non-parametric algorithm for classification and regression based on the majority class of nearest neighbors.
Logistic Regression: A statistical method used for binary classification, predicting the probability of a binary outcome.

The database saved in .csv form contains 28 columns. The first column contains the date (YYYY-MM) from the measurement period. Each subsequent column contains the percentage of search engine, given as a percentage, rounded to 2 decimal places (if the share is less than 0.005%, the value 0 remains, even though it may constitute a very small percentage of the share). We have a total of 191 rows, i.e. almost 16 years of data for each month since January 2009.
